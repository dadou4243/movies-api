            <p>
              The
              <a href="https://cli.angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular CLI</a>
              is a great way to generate a new Angular project along with adding
              new components, modules and services into the application.

              UI library has been used to build the movies table component. It
              offers several built-in features such as columns sorting and
              filtering, row expansion, scroller and more.

        <h3>API</h3>
        <p>
          All the movies data are requested and received from
          <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api" target="_blank"
            >The Movie Database API</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The API is free and offers a large number of methods. The
          documentation is very well written and structured.

        <h3>Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          The project architecture is rather simple. The Angular CLI already
          offers a boilerplate folder structure when the project is initially
          generated using the <code>ng new</code> command.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, there is no need to create several module, and
          therefore, all the components and utility modules are imported to the
          main AppModule.
