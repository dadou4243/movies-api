        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In this page, I will go through the process of building this small
          project. We will look at the different tools used to create the view
          and get the data.

          I also used the PrimeNG UI library to build the data-table.

        <h3>Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          The project architecture is rather simple. The Angular CLI already
          offers a boilerplate folder structure when the project is initially
          generated using the <code>ng new</code> command.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, there is no need to create several module, and
          therefore, all the components and utility modules are imported to the
          AppModule.
